# MERN Travel Booking App  

## Overview

My second project in building a full stack web application. I collaborated with the group of 4 people to build this project. This project is a travel booking app created using MongoDB Atlas as the database, Express JS and Node JS for the backend functionality. React JS and Bootstrap for the front-end.
